                    Our veterinary services cover a range of areas and ensure that your pet stay healthy. At every appointment we check your pet to make sure that their sight, hearing, teeth and bones are healthy. We can also prescribe medication where necessary.

                    <p>
                        Keeping pets well goes very much beyond treating them when they’re sick or injured. Many don’t realise that your pet’s regular health assessment is considered to play an essential role in maintaining their wellbeing. Through a regular visit, at least every 6-12 months, we not only provide essential advice on your pet’s specific care and health needs at each stage of its life, but we can also detect many underlying issues and risks so they can be addressed before they become significant, painful or more costly to treat.

                        We brush our teeth twice a day at least, but what about your cat or dog? Dental healthcare is vitally important for your pet and you can get advice, support, and treatment as required for your pet’s teeth at all our surgeries.

                    <p>
                        Important for non-breeding pets, neutering reduces the risk of diseases such as cancer, removes the risk of problems with the reproductive organs and accidental pregnancy. Neutering is a routine procedure at all our surgeries, and our vets will discuss the most appropriate neutering timescale and approach for your pet.

                    <p>
                        All our practices offer routine vaccinations as part of their standard service and recommend cats, dogs and rabbits are protected against these diseases at an annual appointment. A vaccination appointment is much more than just a quick injection. Our vets and nurses will conduct a full health check on your pet to make sure that nothing is amiss, and will also make sure to listen to any of your worries or concerns. Have a think ahead of time too – your vet will ask you questions about how your pet has been, and if you have noticed any changes.
